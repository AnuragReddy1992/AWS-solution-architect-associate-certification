Okay, hello Cloud Gurus
and welcome to this lecture.
This lecture is on CloudWatch.
Now, so CloudWatch comes up surprisingly a lot
in the Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam.
Used to be more sort of geared
towards the SysOps Administrator Associate
and it still does feature extremely heavily in that as well.
But it does come up in the
Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam
and it is definitely worth three or four marks.
So let's learn what CloudWatch is.
So what is AWS CloudWatch?
Well, CloudWatch is a monitoring service
to monitor your AWS resources,
as well as the applications that you run in AWS.
So CloudWatch basically monitors performance.
Whenever you hear the word CloudWatch, I want you
to think of someone at the gym.
So it's all about performance monitoring,
and CloudWatch can monitor things like Compute.
So inside Compute it can monitor things
like our EC2 instances, it can monitor auto scaling groups,
elastic load balancers, Route53 Health Checks.
Now, I know we haven't covered these off yet.
Don't worry, we are going to cover them off
in the next sections of the course,
but CloudWatch can basically go through and,
not just monitor the EC2 instances,
it can monitor a whole bunch of other things as well.
It can monitor Storage and Content Delivery
and you know all these services,
so it can monitor our EBS volumes.
We can monitor, you know, how busy the volumes are.
We can monitor Storage Gateways,
and we can monitor CloudFront using CloudWatch as well.
So that's all CloudWatch is - it's a monitoring tool.
And like I said, I want you to think
of performance monitoring.
Now CloudWatch with EC2, this is always
a popular exam topic whether
in the Solutions Architect Associate Exam
or whether you're in the
SysOps Administrator Associate Exam.
But essentially CloudWatch can monitor, at host level,
metrics such as CPU.
It can monitor our network, it can monitor our disk,
and it can do a status check.
And it can monitor things like the underlying hypervisor,
whether or not that is running
and then it can also monitor the underlying EC2 instance.
We'll have a look at that in the lab coming up
in the next lecture.
So what Amazon like to do is they like
to try and confuse you and they like to try
and confuse you with CloudTrail
and they always have these questions where you'll
be asked ... given a particular scenario
and then you'll be asked whether you should
be using CloudWatch or CloudTrail.
And so CloudTrail basically is a CCTV
for your AWS environment - increases the visibility
into your users and resource activity
by recording AWS Management Console actions and API calls.
So every time you go in and create a S3 bucket
or an EC2 instance, you're basically making an API call
to AWS, and this is all recorded using CloudTrail,
and you can actually go in and identify which users
and accounts called AWS, the source IP address
from which these calls were made,
and when the calls were made.
So that's what CloudTrail is,
so every time you see CloudTrail,
I want you to imagine a big CCTV camera.
Whenever you see CloudWatch,
I want you to imagine performance.
So CloudWatch monitors performance,
CloudTrail monitors API calls in the AWS platform.
So just remember going into your exam
that CloudWatch is used for monitoring performance,
CloudWatch can monitor most of AWS
as well as your applications that run on AWS,
CloudWatch with EC2 will monitor events
every five minutes by default,
but you can also have detailed monitoring turned on
and that will give you one-minute intervals
and we'll look at how to do that in the next lab.
You can also create CloudWatch alarms
which trigger notifications,
and we did that when we created a billing alarm,
that was essentially creating a CloudWatch alarm
for our billing.
We're going to do that in the next lab as well
but we're going to create some EC2 performance alerts,
and then CloudWatch is all about performance
whereas CloudTrail is about auditing
and I cannot stress that enough
if you see a scenario-based question that's asking,
"Who's provisioning what resource
"in AWS such as S3 or EC2?"
That's always going to be CloudTrail.
If it's asking you what the network throughput is
or the disk IO on your EC2 instance,
that's going to be CloudWatch.
So just remember CloudWatch is about performance,
just think of going to the gym,
whereas CloudTrail is all about auditing,
think of some big CCTV camera
or someone with like a little sort
of detective magnifying glass.
So that is it for this lecture guys.
The best way to learn anything
in AWS is to get our hands dirty with it.
So in the next lecture we're going to go ahead
and go in and provision an EC2 instance
with CloudWatch detailed monitoring turned on.
Then we're going to go in and start stressing
that EC2 instance and see what happens.
So if you got the time, please join me in the next lecture.
Thank you!
