Okay, hello Cloud Gurus,
and welcome to this lecture.
In this lecture, we're going to look at ENI versus
ENA versus EFA.
And you're going to get a whole bunch of different scenario
questions in your exam, and you'll be expected
to know the difference between the three
and where you would use each one.
So let's start with what these actually mean.
And we'll start with ENI.
And this is, Elastic Network Interface.
And essentially, it's just a virtual network card.
That's all it is.
It's one of these bad boys in your EC2 instance.
We didn't have Enhanced Networking.
Enhanced Networking uses what's called single root I/O
virtualization or SR-IOV,
to provide high performance networking capabilities
to unsupported instance types,
and we'll look at that in a little bit more detail.
Now, don't worry that, that slide says EN
and at the top it says ENA.
ENA is a subset of Enhanced networking
and we'll have a look at that when we get to
Enhanced Networking in a couple of slides from now.
And then number three, we also have,
Elastic Fabric Adapter.
And this is a network device that you attach to your
EC2 instance to accelerate High Performance Compute,
so HPC and machine learning applications.
So start with an ENI, like I said,
it's just basically a virtual network card
on your EC2 instance,
when you provision an EC2 instance,
it's going to have a ENI attached to it automatically,
and then you can add additional ones.
It basically allows a primary private IPv4 address,
from the IPv4 address range of your VPC.
And it also allows one or more secondary private
IPv4 addresses from the IPv4
address range of your VPC.
With an ENI you get one elastic IP address,
per private IPv4 address,
you get one public IPv4 address and you get one or more
IPv6 addresses.
And your ENI you'll have one or more security groups
you'll get a MAC address source
and destination check flag
as well as a description of what the ENI is.
So where would you use ENI,
what different kind of scenarios?
Well, you might have multiple ENIs if you want to create
a management network and you wanted to have,
that separate to your production network.
You can also, have an additional ENI
if you're using network and security appliances in your VPC.
It also allows you by having multiple ENIs you can create
dual-homed instances with workloads or roles
on distinct subnets.
You might have your production subnet,
and then you might have your database subnet,
and you might want to segregate that
by using multiple ENIs, and it allows you to create
low budget high availability solutions.
So that's where you're going to use an ENI.
Moving on to Enhanced Networking sometimes,
ENIs are just not capable of, you know,
the network throughput that you need to do
more intense workloads
and that's where you can start using Enhanced Networking.
This uses single root IO virtualization, or SR-IOV,
to provide high performance networking capabilities
on supported instance types.
And SR-IOV is a method of device virtualization,
that provides higher IO performance
and lower CPU utilization,
when compared to traditional network interfaces.
So it's just a way of speeding up your network essentially.
Enhanced Networking provides higher bandwidth,
higher packets per second performance
consistently lower it into instance latencies,
and there's no additional charge
for using Enhanced Networking,
but your EC2 instance does have to support it.
And you're going to use Enhanced Networking
where you want good network performance.
So depending on your instance type,
Enhance Networking can be enabled using two methodologies,
the Elastic Network Adapter or ENA,
which is where we get the word ENA from, in this topic,
and that supports network speeds of up to
100 gigabits per second for supported instance types.
Or you can use the intel 82599 Virtual Function,
or VF interface, which supports network speeds
of up to 10 gigabits per second,
for supported instance types.
And this is typically used on older instances.
So in any scenario, question that you get in your exam,
you probably want to choose ENA over VF,
if you're given the option,
I'm not sure if you will get VF as an option,
most of the time, they just talk about,
hey, you've got a EC2 instances doing really in, you know,
extreme network workloads and you need like,
50 gigabits per second, up and down.
Should you use an ENI or multiple ENI's
or should you use an Elastic Network Adapter,
you want to use Elastic Network Adapter,
because it's built for those speeds.
Adding more and more ENIs won't necessarily
speed up your network throughput.
And then we've got our Elastic Fabric Adapter, EFA.
An Elastic Fabric Adapter is a network device
that you can attach to your EC2 instance
to accelerate High Performance Computing or HPC,
and machine learning applications.
It's really important, if you get a scenario question
and they're talking about ENI versus EFA versus EFA,
and they're talking about HPC and machine learning,
then you want to choose an Elastic Fabric Adapter.
Elastic Fabric Adapters, provide lower
and more consistent latency and higher throughputs
than TCP transport, traditionally used in cloud based,
HPC systems, and EFA can use OS-bypass.
And OS-bypass enables high performance compute
and machine learning applications
to bypass the operating system kernel
and to communicate directly with the EFA device.
It makes it a lot faster with a lot lower latency.
However, it's not supported on Windows currently,
it's only supported with Linux.
So onto my exam tips, you're going to be given
different scenario questions and you'll be asked to choose
whether you should be using an ENI enhance networking
or an Elastic Fabric Adapter.
ENI just use this for basic networking,
perhaps you need a separate management workload
to your production network or a separate logging network
and you need to do this at a low cost.
In this scenario, just use multiple ENI's for each network.
Enhanced Networking is for when you need speeds
between 10 gigabits per second and 100 gigabits per second
anywhere where you need reliable high throughput
and then Elastic Fabric Adapter,
this is where you need to accelerate,
High Performance Computing, HPC
and machine learning applications
or if you need to do an OS bypass.
If you see a scenario questioning,
if you see a scenario question mentioning HPC,
or machine learning or asking about OS-bypass,
then you want to choose an Elastic Fabric Adapter.
So that is it for this lecture, everyone.
If you have any questions, please let me know.
If not feel free to move on to the next lecture. Thank you.
