A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.

Your VPC has an implicit router.
Your VPC automatically comes with a main route table that you can modify.
You can create additional custom route tables for your VPC.
Each subnet must be associated with a route table, which controls the routing for the
subnet. If you don’t explicitly associate a subnet with a particular route table, the subnet
uses the main route table.
You can replace the main route table with a custom table that you’ve created so that each
new subnet is automatically associated with it.
Each route in a table specifies a destination CIDR and a target; for example, traffic
destined for 172.16.0.0/12 is targeted for the VPG. AWS uses the most specific route that
matches the traffic to determine how to route the traffic.
