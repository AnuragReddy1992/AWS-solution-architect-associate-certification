Amazon ElastiCache

Exam Essentials
Know how to use Amazon ElastiCache. Improve the performance of your application by
deploying Amazon ElastiCache clusters as part of your application and offloading read
requests for frequently accessed data. Use the cache-aside pattern in your application first to
check the cache for your query results before checking the database.
Understand when to use a specific cache engine. Amazon ElastiCache gives you the
choice of cache engine to suit your requirements. Use Memcached when you need a simple,
in-memory object store that can be easily partitioned and scaled horizontally. Use Redis when
you need to back up and restore your data, need many clones or read replicas, or are looking
for advanced functionality like sort and rank or leaderboards that Redis natively supports.
Understand how to scale a Redis cluster horizontally. An Amazon ElastiCache cluster
running Redis can be scaled horizontally first by creating a replication group, then by creating
additional clusters and adding them to the replication group.
Understand how to scale a Memcached cluster horizontally. An Amazon ElastiCache
cluster running Memcached can be scaled horizontally by adding or removing additional
cache nodes to the cluster. The Amazon ElastiCache client library supports Auto Discovery
and can discover new nodes added or removed from the cluster without having to hardcode
the list of nodes.
Know how to back up your Amazon ElastiCache cluster. You can create a snapshot to
back up your Amazon ElastiCache clusters running the Redis engine. Snapshots can be
created automatically on a daily basis or manually on demand. Amazon ElastiCache clusters
running Memcached do not support backup and restore natively.
Exercises
In this section, you will create a cache cluster using Amazon ElastiCache, expand the cluster
with additional nodes, and finally create a replication group with an Amazon ElastiCache
Redis cluster.
EXERCISE 10.1
Create an Amazon ElastiCache Cluster Running Memcached
In this exercise, you will create an Amazon ElastiCache cluster using the Memcached
engine.
1. While signed into the AWS Management Console, open the Amazon ElastiCache
service dashboard.
2. Begin the launch and configuration process to create a new Amazon ElastiCache
cluster.
3. Select the Memcached cache engine, and configure the cluster name, number of
nodes, and node type.
4. Optionally configure the security group and maintenance window as needed.
5. Review the cluster configuration, and begin provisioning the cluster.
6. Connect to the cluster with any Memcached client using the DNS name of the
cluster.
You have now created your first Amazon ElastiCache cluster.
EXERCISE 10.2
Expand the Size of a Memcached Cluster
In this exercise, you will expand the size of an existing Amazon ElastiCache Memcached
cluster.
1. Launch a Memcached cluster using the steps defined in Exercise 10.1.
2. Go to the Amazon ElastiCache dashboard, and view the details of your existing
cluster.
3. View the list of nodes currently provisioned, and then add one additional node by
increasing the number of nodes.
4. Apply the configuration change, and wait for the new node to finish the provisioning
process.
5. Verify that the new node has been created, and connect to the node using a
Memcached client.
In this exercise, you have horizontally scaled an existing Amazon ElastiCache cluster by
adding a cache node.
EXERCISE 10.3
Create an Amazon ElastiCache Cluster and Redis Replication Group
In this exercise, you will create an Amazon ElastiCache cluster using Redis nodes, create
a replication group, and set up a read replica.
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console, and navigate to the Amazon ElastiCache
service dashboard.
2. Begin the configuration and launch process for a new Amazon ElastiCache cluster.
3. Select the Redis cache engine, and then configure a replication group and the node
type.
4. Configure a read replica by setting the number of read replicas to 1, and verify that
Enable Replication and Multi-AZ are selected.
5. Adjust the Availability Zones for the primary and read replica clusters, security
groups, and maintenance window, as needed.
6. Review the cluster configuration, and begin provisioning the cluster.
7. Connect to the primary node and the read replica node with a Redis client library.
Perform a simple set operation on the primary node, and then perform a get
operation with the same key on the replica.
You have now created an Amazon ElastiCache cluster using the Redis engine and
configured a read replica.
