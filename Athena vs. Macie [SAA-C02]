Okay, hello, Cloud Gurus
and welcome to this lecture.
In this lecture, we're going to look at the
difference between Athena and Macie.
And this can be a very popular exam topic
comparing the two different services.
And they'll give you a scenario and they'll ask you
which service to choose.
So why don't we start with Athena?
What is Athena?
Well, Athena is an interactive query service,
which enables you to analyze and query data located in S3
using standard SQL.
So this is a really cool service, you can basically use SQL.
I don't know if you're familiar with SQL, but it's, you
know, basically a language that you use to get
knowledge out of databases.
So it could be using Microsoft SQL Server, or My SQL,
you would basically say something like, hey, select star
from this table, and that would show you the entire table.
So maybe you want to see all your students in a table in a
database, you'd say, hey, select star from the students
table, and that will show you all your students
in that table in that database.
So that's all that sequel is.
This, effectively allows you to turn S3 into a giant
database and you can actually query S3 using standard SQL.
Now the cool thing about Athena is that it's serverless.
There's nothing to provision you pay per query
or per terabyte scanned.
There's no need to set up complex extract transform load
or ETL processes.
So how do you get your data out of S3?
How do you put it into something like RDS?
You don't need to worry about any of that Athena will
basically allow you to turn S3 into a database,
you can run SQL queries against it.
And it works directly with data stored in S3.
So where would you use this?
Well it can be used to query log files stored in S3.
So this could be your elastic load balancer logs,
which we will cover off in the next section of the course,
could be S3, access logs, etc.
You can also use it to generate business reports
on data stored in S3.
So maybe you want to run queries against your payroll data.
You can use it to analyze AWS cost and usage reports.
And you can run queries on click stream data
that's stored in S3 as well.
So now that we know what Athena is, what is Macie?
Well, let's start with what PII is, first.
what is PII?
PII is just personally identifiable information.
And this is information that's used to establish
a person's identity.
So this data could be exploited by criminals
and used in identity theft or financial fraud.
Some examples of PII might be your home address,
it could be your email address, it could be your
social security number, your passport number,
your driver's license number, your credit card numbers,
your date of birth, phone number, bank account number,
credit card number, et cetera.
That's all that PII is.
Now what is Macie?
Well, Macie a security service that uses machine learning
and natural language processing or NLP to discover,
classify and protect sensitive data stored in S3.
So it uses AI to recognize if your S3 objects contain
sensitive data such as PII and it basically gives
you dashboards, reporting and alerts.
And it works directly with the data stored in S3.
And it can also analyze CloudTrail logs.
And this is great for PCI DSS.
So if you're taking credit card payments on your website,
as well as preventing ID theft.
Now you can see why people get the two confused
cause the Athena allows you to query your data
on S3 based off SQL Server, sorry,
based off SQL commands that you write.
However, Macie it also queries data on S3,
but it's using machine learning and natural language
processing to discover PII information.
So there's similar but different services.
So going into your exam, just remember what Athena is
and what it allows you to do.
It's an interactive query service.
It allows you to query your data located in S3 using
standard SQL, it's serverless, and it's commonly used
to analyze log data stored in S3,
whereas Macie is essentially as a security service
it uses AI to analyze your data in S3
and help identify personally identifiable information
or PII.
It can be used to analyze CloudTrail logs for suspicious
API activities, includes dashboards, reports and alerting.
And it's great for PCI DSS compliance
and for preventing ID theft.
So if you know the difference between a Athena
and Macie going into your exam,
you're going to do very, very well.
So that is it for this lecture, everyone.
If you have any questions, please let me know.
If not, feel free to move on to the next lecture.
Thank you.
